## Learn Music Notes

A fork of FercaNet's _Learn Music Notes_, an Android app that lets you practise sight reading.
The code this was forked from was pulled from F-Droid's repository on December 3rd, 2016. It linked to a [broken Sourceforge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learnmusicnotes/), so no idea where the original code comes from.
